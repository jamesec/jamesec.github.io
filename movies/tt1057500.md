# Invictus (2009) movie review
`Nov 28, 2025`

The runtime for *Invictus (2009)* is 2:13:38. Its storyline is like this:

“This movie tells the inspiring true story of how Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) joined forces with the Captain of South Africa's rugby team, François Pienaar (Matt Damon) to help unite their country. Newly-elected President Mandela knows his nation remains racially and economically divided in the wake of Apartheid. Believing he can bring his people together through the universal language of sport, Mandela rallies South Africa's rugby team as they make their run to the 1995 Rugby World Cup Championship match.”—alfiehitchie

From `27:56` to `35:16`, it shows strong Persisting psychological processes in the protagonist.

- `32:06` I am here because I **believe** you have made a decision with insufficient information and foresight. 
- `32:28` Nonetheless, I **believe** we **should** restore this Springboks. 
- `32:50` Let me tell you why. 

“Believe” and “should” are common words used by a person with strong Persisting processes, and the style is democratic rather than autocratic, benevolent, or laissez-faire. So he would “tell you why.” And he further explained the reason to Brenda later:

- `36:18` If we take away what they cherish, this Springboks, their national anthem, we just reinforce **the cycle of fear** between us. I will do what I must to stop that cycle. Or it will destroy us. 

There’s at least one more scene that shows typical Persisting processes—for example, when Mandela talks with his daughter Zindzi from `51:20` to `52:30`.

- Excuse me. 
- What do you think? 
	- It doesn't matter what I think.
- Yes, it does. 
	- Okay. I think he looks like one of the policemen who forced us out of our house when you were in jail. I don't like seeing you shake his hand, and I'm not the only one. 
- You criticize without understanding. You seek only to address your own personal feelings. That is selfish thinking, Zindzi. It does not serve the nation. Zindzi, wait, please. 

In the last part, he’s judging his daughter, and he's in the Persisting-process-Driver, Be Perfect for Me. We can adjust what he says to make the Persisting-process more obvious, like this:
> **In my opinion**, you criticize without understanding. You seek only to address your own personal feelings. I **believe** you’re being selfish, Zindzi. It does not serve the nation.

And he's using big words, such as “serve the nation,” which is a sign of the Persisting-process-Driver.

When he says, "Zindzi, wait, please," he seems to regret what he just said and returns to a calmer state.

At the beginning of this scene, when he asks his daughter to comment on the newspaper picture showing him shaking hands with the captain of South Africa's rugby team, he is seeking recognition from her, wanting to be seen and to have his convictions and work acknowledged. When that doesn’t happen, it partly explains why he loses control and slips into an uneasy state—like low psychological energy—because even his personal assistant, Brenda, cannot understand or validate his brilliant strategy.

If he could maintain his psychological energy and attune himself to Zindzi, he could have validated her first and approached the interaction positively, saying something like this instead:
> I hear your pain, Zindzi, and forgiveness is the path that frees both heart and nation. I am here whenever you wish to talk.

Overall, this movie demonstrates positive Persisting processes.
