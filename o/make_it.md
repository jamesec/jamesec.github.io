Fake it till you make it.

This is a **playful** statement, and don’t take it too seriously. Which means, someone found it’s hard to adopt certain behaviors, so they imitate that behavior, i.e., "fake it," first. Then, gradually, they become more fluent in that behavior, incorporating it into their own will, and it becomes one of their natural processes, that's "make it".

Take "Fake it till you make it" as more of a playful suggestion.

- "Faking it till you make it" is a psychological tool discussed in neuroscientific research. A 1988 experiment by Fritz Strack claimed to show that mood can be improved by holding a pen between the user's teeth to force a smile, but a posterior experiment failed to replicate it, due to which Strack was awarded **the Ig Nobel Prize for psychology** in 2019. A later 2022 study about strategies to counter emotional distress found forced smiling not more effective than forced neutral expressions and other strategies of emotional regulation.
