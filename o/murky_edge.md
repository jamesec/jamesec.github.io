For me, Focusing is a fresh thing that I have to do now. So when I come into myself, and I say "how are you?", I find certain feelings there. Some of them are there everyday, and some of them are there only now, but I **mostly** I find feelings **that I can immediately identify**. "Oh yes that, oh yes that, oh yes that..." **That's NOT Focusing**.

For me, Focusing is when I spend time going directly to that whatever it is there. If I say to myself, "yes yes, but are you happy or are you comfortable" or "can we be joyful" or beyond the feelings, I have to say hello to all the feelings, I have to do that.

I say hello to them all, there's that, there's that, there's that, and one or another may even require some work - so I work for a while, and typically after maybe sometime, 3 or 4 or 5 or 10 minutes something like that, then I say - oh but you haven't focused yet - which means to me you haven't remembered **to go freshly to that edge there where you don't know**. So if you're new to Focusing, this may be confusing to you, but I will make it more clear. 

Another way to say it is, there's **a huge difference** between **a feeling when you just feel it** and **a feeling that you are next to**, a feeling that you receive, a feeling that you even welcome or acknowledge, a feeling that you touch because then you are not that feeling, you touch it. And the people who spoke before brought us that in - before the break, many of them, there is this and there is that.

---

Yes, so two points I'm making, one is Focusing for me is **spending time with what's directly here but not clear**, and may have to welcome the feelings that are clear to me first, I meant, just, "Yeah, I'm still upset about what happened last night." "Oh yes, that's right, and now I'm discouraged, and I can't start to work until I get my discouraged over to the side." "Oh yes, yes, yes, oh yes," and there may be some new, new ones there. "Yeah, I see, okay, what's that, what's that?" But then at some point, I have to go to what I'm gonna call - this is a technical term - what I'm gonna call **the murky edge**. 

Now murky - if you don't know English very well - it's a funny word, murky means **unclear, foggy**, murk is the kind of weather when there's so much fog and rain that you can't tell where you are very well, that kind of a place. I have to go to "how are you?", where the answer is some kind of body sense that's not completely happy. You're following me?

Now, if I find that completely happy, I'm just grateful, that's fine, then I'm finished, because that happens once a year {*audiences laughing*}, and so might as well enjoy it. But usually, if I say, "Are you comfortable, are you happy, are you ready to go, are you joyful?" it says, "Errr." And then I have to say, "Okay, what's 'errr'?" And that's something like standing in front of a gray wall, and somebody says, "What do you see?" You know, "Well, nothing."

It's like going into a piece of wood. At first, it's impossible, and then a few seconds later, "Oh yeah, there's all this intricacy there," and that's Focusing for me. Okay? So that's my main point. But **my second point** is, yes - to welcome, to acknowledge, to touch the feelings, that's also Focusing. To be next to them.

So in Afghanistan, there is - they - they use **Rumi**, who is the **poet**, who said all your feelings are really guests. So go out and welcome each guest, and that's very right, because then **you are not the guest, you own the house**.

And you welcome them, and you say, "Oh yes, you know, you feel bad, but you're bringing me something or I don't know yet what I'm gonna do with you, but here's a room for you," and you take them upstairs, and you show them where they can be or acknowledge them. And all the time there's YOU. YOU welcome them, YOU acknowledge them, YOU touch them, YOU are next to them. Yes?

And then when you've done that, **then go to the murky edge please**.

So I want to say what someone said here earlier, the six steps are not very good. It would be better to start **teaching Focusing from the murky edge**, and from **welcoming the guests** and from **being YOU next to, not identified with the feelings**.

Or, another way I love saying it, **it's better to start teaching Focusing with something that people will NOT understand**. So that they would be interested, because if you start with what is obvious, they say, "Yeah, yeah, that's a very good thing," and they're finished with you.

So I find a lot of people, when I go to that - don't anymore - but I used to go to these big conventions, people say, "Oh, Gene Gendlin, Focusing! Hello, hello~" and then they'll go somewhere else, because Focusing, anybody who is not out of touch has that already. See what I mean? Okay, that point isn't you.

### The Guest House by Jalaluddin Rumi
*Translated by Coleman Barks*

```text
This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if theyâ€™re a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.
```
