EFT distinguishes 4 types of emotion response, and it's an important distinction for us in EFT that not all emotion is the same. Some kinds of emotion responses are constructive, and others are getting in the way or don't help people deal with situations.

So, the first of these four kinds of emotion responses are **primary adaptive emotions**, and these are the natural sort of biologically or evolutionarily given emotion responses. So, if I am having my boundaries violated, someone is invading my privacy or damaging my property, then that's a violation of my boundaries, and I will appropriately and adaptively become angry. The anger will help me to maintain and guard my boundary; in other words, I'll go to my boundary and I'll say, "that's enough of that, please stop, I need you to stop." I'll make a boundary, so that's an adaptive anger; that's anger which helps me to maintain a boundary in the face of a violation of that boundary. So, that's a useful emotion, that's part of our evolutionary heritage, and people do not get stuck in adaptive anger.

They do however, get stuck in maladaptive anger, and that's an anger which it feels like it's about things that have happened in the past. It's an old, bad, stuck feeling, and it's, so it's like people always mistreat me, people always take advantage of me, I never get a fair break, people are always breaking my... violating my boundaries. And this maladaptive anger doesn't help people cope; it's, you know, part of what we mean by road rage. It gets involved in various kinds of harmful or damaging anger expression, and so it isn't useful, and it's, and when we talk about adaptive and maladaptive, we're really talking about whether something is useful or not useful. So, **primary maladaptive emotion** is the person's first response to situation which, because of their history of previous events, they now overreact to in a way that doesn't fit the situation.

The third kind of emotion response that we distinguish, we call **secondary reactive emotion**. And here, the word secondary simply means it came second; there was a first response which could have been a useful or adaptive first response or a not useful or not adaptive, maladaptive first response, and then the person had a response to that emotional response. So, for example, someone insults my pride, and I get angry. So, my first emotion is shame, and then I get angry about the shame, and I then attack. And this tends to be, as I said, the kind of anger that gets out of control, that causes damage in relationships. And so, secondary reactive anger, people get stuck in and cause their problems to get worse. So, what our clients come to us commonly with is secondary reactive emotions of various kinds. People with explosive anger problems or anger, so-called anger management problems, typically have a secondary reactive of anger processes, or they might have primary maladaptive anger responses, which is like a chip on their shoulder where everything is an insult and everything feels like a violation. And so, our clients come to us with secondary reactive emotion responses and primary maladaptive emotion responses, and this is what we then try to help our clients work with and how to help them move towards a primary adaptive emotion response, which is often before or underneath, say, a secondary reactive emotion.

The fourth and final type of emotion response is an **instrumental emotion response**.

This is an emotion which is displayed for its intended effect, regardless of what the person actually feels. So, instrumental anger commonly takes the form of bullying or some kind of deliberate behavior to intimidate other people.

Another example of instrumental anger is something that I was taught as a young person growing up in California where there are mountain lions. What you need to know about meeting a mountain lion in a sort of mountain path in California is that you must never run away from them, because they will chase after you and attack then. Instead, what you do is you step forward, you raise your arms, spread them apart, and you yell at them with a loud voice. This is instrumental anger, right? You might be terrified inside, but you're trying to scare away the mountain lion by intimidating it. So, that's, of course, a useful and adaptive use of an instrumental emotion response.

In our interpersonal relationships, we get things like bullying, and people putting on emotions in ways to cover up emotions, so instrumental emotions can become manipulative in relationships and damage them, but many instrumental emotions are actually quite useful.
