# Email with your own domain
`Addendum added on January 22, 2025 / May 30, 2024`

One of the easiest ways to use email with your own domain.

Get your own domain from [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) or [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/).

Get a `Tuta Mail` account through [my referal link](https://app.tuta.com/signup?ref=VTBEVVg3WnU), if you're ok with it.

You can register for a free account first, then upgrade to paid plan at a later time.

Set up `Tuta Mail` with your own domain. Refer to this video for steps:<br>

Alternatively, you can choose [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail) or other encrypted mail services, depending on factors such as pricing, offerings, and your user experience preferences. For example,
- Mail Plus, `Proton Mail`
	- 1 custom domain
	- $3.99 /month - paid yearly
- Revolutionary, `Tuta Mail`
	- 3 custom domains
	- €3 /month - paid yearly

Now you have an email address with your own domain, enhancing your personal branding!

Consider protecting yourself from spam emails:
- Never share your email IDs publicly.
- On your website, use a contact form to hide your email.
- Avoid responding to spam emails and ignore any email attachments.
- Don't click on unknown or suspicious links; always think twice before clicking.

This email with your custom domain can serve as your primary email. Therefore, consider creating a separate email address specifically for online purchases, and email subscriptions, etc. This way, if the email address receives spam, it won't clutter your primary inbox. For one-time registrations or situations where you're unsure about the legitimacy of a website, you can also use disposable email addresses from services like [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/).
