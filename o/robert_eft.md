I'm Robert Elliot, and I'm going to talk about myself and how I came to EFT.

I was trained as a clinical psychologist in the United States, where I worked almost, for almost 30 years, and during that time and in my training before that, I learned many different approaches to therapy, I was trained originally by a student of Carl Rogers in person-centered therapy, and then I had training in family systemic therapy, in psychodynamic therapy, in behavior therapy, before there was such a thing as cognitive-behavioral therapy.

About 1985, I was working in, I was on sabbatical in the UK and I was doing a presentation on my research, and I presented some data and an old analyst challenged me, by making a psychodynamic interpretation of some of my client's data, my client was reporting on a dream interpretation, and her experiences of this dream interpretation, and the analyst came up with some psychodynamic interpretation of this dream the client that had, and I said, well, we don't do that in our research, we don't interpret... we take the client's... what the client says to us at face value.

And, the analyst said, well, you don't do that in your practice, there you are interpreting your client's dream, right? So why not interpret their...? And I said, well that... wait... I was scandalized by that, and I said, no, we just don't do it, he said, well, aren't you being inconsistent? And, I said, yes, I am being inconsistent.

I thought about that when I went back to the United States, and I said, you know, my use of psychodynamic interpretation is not consistent with my practice, by this time, I'd tried behavior therapy, it didn't work for me and my clients.

Laura Rice and Les Greenberg were wanting to begin work on developing an integrative humanistic therapy that pulled together person-centered and Gestalt therapy, maybe with some existential things. And, I said, you know, I want to focus on my person-centered experiential roots as a therapist, I want to give up psychodynamically interpreting my clients, and I want to, like, kind of integrate myself better, because I've been working as an eclectic therapist, and so we agreed to work together, we started developing this therapy.

I said to Laura Rice, I'm attached to my interpretations, because growing up in my family, I was considered to be clever, and my parents loved that when I came up with clever interpretations of things, so I'm very attached to interpreting my clients, and I want to stop doing that. And, Laura said to me, I'll never forget this, she said, I'll tell you what I do, she was trained by Carl Rogers, and so it was, you know, **I'll tell you what I do, when I want to interpret my client**.
> I say to myself, no matter how clever your interpretation is, what your client is going to come up with, through the therapeutic process, figuring out for themselves, **is always going to be different and better than whatever you've got**.

You know what, that's true. And I said, you know, that actually fits my experience of when I interpret my clients. If it works at best, it's not the thing I came up with its originally to whatever the client did with what I came up with.

**So I let go of my urge to interpret**, and we began developing this therapy. I was the test subject, basically my team at the University of Toledo on Ohio, were doing a research study - this is the first study on EFT. We started in 1985 we were doing a study of depression, so we're developing this therapy, this integrated humanistic experiential therapy for depression, and my students and I would see these depressed clients and I'd take my recordings up to Toronto and I'd get supervision from Laura and Les, and we used that to develop the therapy.

Now, the therapy fits my... fits who I am very well, not the interpretation, not the not-interpretation part, but because **it emphasizes getting deep inside the client's experience, but also being quite active and adventurous and curious**, so these qualities, for me, are part of my background and my family, is sort of our adventurous nature or curiosity, the fact that we like to sort of actively engage with things, we're not passive observers, and so, all this came together for me and really made EFT a really good fit for me, and so, over a period of about five or seven years, working with Laura and Les, **we together developed the model that became Emotion-Focused Therapy**.
