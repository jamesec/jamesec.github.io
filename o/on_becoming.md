**Insightful, Practical, and Deeply Human**

This is a great book — highly recommended for therapists and those training to become one.

What I appreciate most are the personal stories Leslie weaves into the text, the chapters on empathy (Chapter 5) and Dialectical Constructivist Theory (Chapter 10), and especially the 100 tips on how to become more emotion-focused.
