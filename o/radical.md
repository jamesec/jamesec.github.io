We cannot fix ourselves and no one else can fix us. And we cannot change through willpower, it just doesn’t work. We cannot change through trying to control who we are and how we feel.

And so the darkest feelings inside us, and the places in us that we most think are our enemy, are the ones we need to throw the door open and invite in, as the guests, as the honored guests.

Because they are the ones, they are the only ones who will show us our way forward. <span style="border-bottom: 1.5px solid; border-bottom-color:#f55066;">It’s the dark places inside us that hold the life energy</span>, and our life energy has been bound up in trying to hold those places hidden, where if instead of that, <span style="border-bottom: 1.5px solid; border-bottom-color:#f55066;">we turn toward them with</span> <mark>radical acceptance</mark>, <span style="border-bottom: 1.5px solid; border-bottom-color:#f55066;">they themselves are the ones who will lead us forward.</span>

	- What you think is your enemy is not your enemy.
	- It is a part of you trying to save you.
	- That doesn’t mean you have to act in the ways that it urges.
	- Your actions can **come from wholeness**, not from parts of you.
