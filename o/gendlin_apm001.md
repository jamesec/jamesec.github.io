A Process Model (2017) by Eugene T. Gendlin

---

I’m taking notes for Chapter 1 (Body-Environment) of this book, as follows.

- **_En#1_** is the spectator’s environment, what spectators define in **_their_** en which may affect an organism.
	- The spectator defines these en factors as there, separately from the animal. The spectator may also note something (pollution for example) that is about to affect the animal while the animal does not yet notice. 
- **_En#2_** is the reflexively identical environment; it is identical with the organism’s living process. Body and en are one event, one process.
	- The en#2 is not the separable environment but the environment participating in a living process.
	- The en#2 is a function of ongoing living, and exists only in that living.
	- En#2 is always in some process and identical with the body-in-some-process.
- **_En#3_** is the environment that has been arranged by the body-en#2 process. The body accumulates (is) a resulting environment. 
	- The body **_is_** an environment **_in which_** body-process goes **_on further_**.
	- The body structure is not only made but also maintained by ongoing processes—if they stop, the body disintegrates.
	- When aspects of en#3 get reinvolved in life process, they are thereby also en#2 (both within and outside the skin-envelope body).
	- The process **_is_** body-en#2 and **_goes on in_** body-en#3. But only some results of life become en#3, only those **_in which_** it goes on. En#1 is what the spectator observes all around the body, but the body also has its own environment which it has made.
	- From most any single bone of some animal paleontologists can derive not just the rest of the body but also the kind of environment and terrain in which the animal lived.
	- The body is in the environment but the environment is also in the body, and is the body. We can say that en#3 participates in en#2, or we can say that the body-en#2 process goes on in the en#3.
- **_En#0_** is a fourth type. Something may someday affect the life process and be en#2, but is not now. This has never happened, and is not now any creature’s en, not even the spectator’s.
	- Since this has no reality as en#2, and since en#3 is the result of en#2, we need a term for “environment” that has never been functioning in a life process.
	- In these definitions process is first. We don’t assume the “body” and the “environment” and then put them together. Later we will develop terms to speak of “the body.” Right now it is b-en#2.
	- Body structure is always involved in some processes, or else it disintegrates. It is a structure from process, for further process, and only so.
