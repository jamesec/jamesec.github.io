A Process Model (2017) by Eugene T. Gendlin

---

I’m taking notes for Chapter 1 (Body-Environment) of this book, as follows.

## Book notes
- **_En#1_** is the spectator’s environment, what spectators define in **_their_** en which may affect an organism.
	- The spectator defines these en factors as there, separately from the animal. The spectator may also note something (pollution for example) that is about to affect the animal while the animal does not yet notice. 
- **_En#2_** is the reflexively identical environment; it is identical with the organism’s living process. Body and en are one event, one process.
	- The en#2 is not the separable environment but the environment participating in a living process.
	- The en#2 is a function of ongoing living, and exists only in that living.
	- En#2 is always in some process and identical with the body-in-some-process.
- **_En#3_** is the environment that has been arranged by the body-en#2 process. The body accumulates (is) a resulting environment. 
	- The body **_is_** an environment **_in which_** body-process goes **_on further_**.
	- The body structure is not only made but also maintained by ongoing processes—if they stop, the body disintegrates.
	- When aspects of en#3 get reinvolved in life process, they are thereby also en#2 (both within and outside the skin-envelope body).
	- The process **_is_** body-en#2 and **_goes on in_** body-en#3. But only some results of life become en#3, only those **_in which_** it goes on. En#1 is what the spectator observes all around the body, but the body also has its own environment which it has made.
	- From most any single bone of some animal paleontologists can derive not just the rest of the body but also the kind of environment and terrain in which the animal lived.
	- The body is in the environment but the environment is also in the body, and is the body. We can say that en#3 participates in en#2, or we can say that the body-en#2 process goes on in the en#3.
- **_En#0_** is a fourth type. Something may someday affect the life process and be en#2, but is not now. This has never happened, and is not now any creature’s en, not even the spectator’s.
	- Since this has no reality as en#2, and since en#3 is the result of en#2, we need a term for “environment” that has never been functioning in a life process.
	- In these definitions process is first. We don’t assume the “body” and the “environment” and then put them together. Later we will develop terms to speak of “the body.” Right now it is b-en#2.
	- Body structure is always involved in some processes, or else it disintegrates. It is a structure from process, for further process, and only so.

> The body of any creature is the result of its life process. En#3 includes **the beaver’s felled tree**, but also the beaver’s body. The environment which the process produces is wider, but it includes the body.

- Why do beavers chop down trees?
	- Beavers use the trees they cut down **for food**, and they use the left over branches **for building materials for their dams and lodges**. In cold weather climates beavers are most active cutting down trees in the fall because they are preparing for the winter.
- How long does it take for a beaver to cut down a tree?
	- Beavers have very strong and sharp teeth which are paired with powerful jaw muscles. **A single beaver can fell a medium sized tree in a single night!** Beaver teeth never stop growing, so it is believed that beavers need to constantly chew wood to prevent their teeth from growing too long!
- What do beavers do after the tree falls?
	- Unfortunately, some trees have fallen on the beaver. They down larger trees closer to water. After the tree has fallen, they trim the branches for use in building dams. They prefer transporting branches about 3- to 6 feet long and about 1- to 2 inches in diameter.
- [What beavers eat](https://westernbeavers.org/beaver-grocery-stores/)
	- Trees that make up the beaver diet include bark from willow, cottonwood, aspen, poplar, maple, birch, oak, alder, black cherry and apple trees. Beavers will gnaw on trees until they fall, and then they clip branches from the resulting logs and add them to their food stash. While beavers will sometimes eat fir, pine and other conifers, they do not favor them for food. They will often use such trees for dam building, however, or fell them to allow their favorite foods to grow instead. You can spot areas of beaver lumbering where there are sharply pointed tree trunks, with grooves from their teeth marks, as well as piles of wood shaving around the trunks. **One adult beaver can fell as many as 300 trees in a year!**
