`July 24, 2025`  
I experimented with the "now" page thing — it was like a digital pet I forgot to feed.  
Turns out, regularly updating what I'm doing now isn't my thing.  
So, this page is retired and living here in the archive lounge.

# What I’m doing now
`May 22, 2024`

This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

## Rick and Morty
I'm watching [Rick and Morty the TV show](https://youtube.com/watch?v=O9B1oIev_iI) ([FREE 24/7 MARATHON](https://adultswim.com/streams/rick-and-morty)), one episode per day. It's such a great show! Violent, entertaining, and thought-provoking.

I especially love the rhythm and the music. My top episodes for the first two seasons:
- S01E04 M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
- S02E05 Get Schwifty
- S02E06 The Ricks Must Be Crazy

[One True Morty](/o/s.htm?p=morty), from S01E10 - Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind, is therapeutic and healing. 

## Learning several things
I'm learning several things. 

First of all, learning **UX design**, taking courses, reading books, and doing mini projects.

### Spanish
One day, I asked ChatGPT:<br>
`Let me know the top 6 languages in which you have the highest proficiency and knowledge.`

The answer is: English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese (Mandarin), and Japanese.

I'm learning Spanish with [Coffee Break Spanish Podcast](https://coffeebreaklanguages.com/coffeebreakspanish/). Considering to take courses via [Live Lingua](https://livelingua.com/).

### Polyvagal theory
In the mental health and psychotherapy field, I'm learning Polyvagal theory.

There's an article, the title of which is interesting:<br>
[Don't talk to me now, I'm scanning for danger](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/597c98325016e1ac9a77e8ec/t/5fdb8ec77a6fba590f69948d/1621527113005/Stephen+Porges+interview_Don%27t+talk+to+me+now+I%27m+scanning+for+danger+copy.pdf)<br>

[Jan Winhall](https://janwinhall.com/)'s FSPM is an elegant and minimal model for treating trauma and addiction, I like it.

I'm watching [videos from her YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@JanWinhall/videos), and reading her book:<br>
Treating Trauma and Addiction with the Felt Sense Polyvagal Model (2021)

Also, looking forward to her new book, which is expected to be published on March 18, 2025:<br>
20 Embodied Practices for Healing Trauma and Addiction: Using the Felt Sense Polyvagal Model (2025)
