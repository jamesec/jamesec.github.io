# Tech stack of this website
`Updated: July 9, 2025 / April 15, 2024`

This is a so-called tech stack, just for fun. It's not that technical. Typically, when there's a front-end, back-end, etc., it's referred to as a tech **stack**. However, this one is very simple and minimalistic.

## GitHub Pages site
I set up this as a GitHub Pages website, it's free.

[Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)

If you set up your GitHub Pages website with the repository name as
`<your_github_username>.github.io`, you'll get a website at this URL:
`https://<your_github_username>.github.io`

More about GitHub Pages site.
- [About GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
	- Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.
	- GitHub Pages sites have a *soft* bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.
- [Securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https)
	- Under "GitHub Pages," select Enforce HTTPS.

## Use a static site generator?
By default, GitHub Pages recommend Jekyll, which is a static site generator written in Ruby.

You can also use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), another static site generator, which claims to be the world’s fastest framework for building websites.

Instead of using a static site **generator**, plain HTML pages are fine too, you can even write every web pages using HTML codes, manually by yourself!

But you don't have to, you can pick a responsive HTML template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

For example:
[Debit & Credit User Guide](https://debitandcredit.app/help/)
> Design: HTML5 UP

### Tech stack of this website - that's it
As of April 2024, this website currently consists solely of my own static HTML pages. You can view the source code of this website [here](https://github.com/jamesec/jamesec.github.com).

I utilize [mvp.css](https://github.com/andybrewer/mvp) and [Tokyo Night theme for Obsidian](https://github.com/tcmmichaelb139/obsidian-tokyonight/) for the styles and [zero-md](https://github.com/zerodevx/zero-md) to parse my Markdown pages, which are written in the [Obsidian App](https://obsidian.md/).

Such is the tech stack of this website - and that's it.

#### Addendum added on July 9, 2025
Using a Markdown parser/loader is not ideal for search engine optimization (SEO), so I added a `sitemap.xml` file generated by [xml-sitemaps.com](https://xml-sitemaps.com/).

## 2FAS Authenticator for GitHub
To log in to GitHub, you need a two-factor authentication or a one-time password app. 

`Updated on July 9, 2025`  
I've replaced Raivo with [2FAS Auth Mobile App](https://2fas.com/auth/) on my iPhone, as Raivo’s acquisition by Mobime has raised privacy concerns about the popular authenticator app.

- [Raivo Acquisition Raises Privacy Concerns](https://safenotscammed.com/raivo-acquisition-raises-privacy-concerns/)

<del>I recommend using `Raivo Authenticator`, which I use on my iPhone.</del>

## Write something for your website
I use [Obsidian App](https://obsidian.md/) to write in [Markdown](https://markdownguide.org/).

I've tried other Markdown editors, but most of them are jokes. However, Obsidian App literally changed my life. I use it to build my knowledge base as my second brain and also as a writing tool. It's free for personal use and highly recommended.

## Use your own domain name
To buy a domain name, you can visit [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com), which is recommended by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/ti). Alternatively, you can choose another domain name provider, such as [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com).

A top-level .org domain can cost less than $10 per year.

Then configure it properly.
[Configuring a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

Basically, it's to create a `CNAME` record in your domain provider's system.

That is, to create a `CNAME` record that points `<your_domain_name>.org_or_com_etc.` to `<your_github_username>.github.io`.

After setting up your own domain name,
`https://<your_github_username>.github.io` will be redirected to your
`https://<your_domain_name>.org_or_com_etc.`

## Final words
Hope you enjoy buiding your own website too! :-)
