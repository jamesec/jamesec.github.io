This book is about the life and work of Eric Berne, the founder of Transactional Analysis, as a psychotherapy school. Stewart not only delves into Berne's theoretical frameworks but also sheds light on his practical applications, demonstrating how Transactional Analysis has been utilized in therapeutic settings to promote personal growth and effective communication.

Below are my reading notes.

## pp. 69-70, The psychotherapist's responsibility
Berne also rejected the comfortable suggestion that 'therapists cannot help people; they have got to help themselves'. He commented:
> If a guy who really knows his own job comes for psychotherapy and you say, 'I can't help you; you've got to help yourself,' he'll just walk out. And I don't blame him. (Berne 1971: 11)

Berne underlined this view with another of his favourite metaphors, that of the 'psychotherapist as skilled craftsman'. In the last public speech he ever gave, he said:
> Personally I'm a head mechanic - that's all I am. Like you come in with wheels wrong in your head, and I'll say, 'Okay we'll try and fix your head.' . . . And if you're going to do that then the first thing you have to learn is simple, pure psychotherapy. (Berne 1971: 12)

The 'head mechanic' had already made his appearance in Berne's story of the boiler-banging engineer:
> The approach is that of the engineer who was called to repair a boiler. He found a stuck valve, rapped it sharply and restored service. He submitted a bill for $100. The owner said that was a lot for a single hammer blow; he requested an itemized statement. The engineer wrote back: '**Hitting boiler with hammer, $1.00. Knowing where to hit, $99**.' (Berne 1963a: 3)

Often, the 'skilled craftsman' in Berne's stories was a shrewd, case-hardened medical doctor. For example, Berne told the tale of a man who got a splinter in his toe. Soon the toe became infected, and the man began to limp. To compensate for the limp he tightened up his leg and back muscles. As the tension spread to his neck, he developed a headache. Meantime, he began to run a fever as a result of the infection in his toe. The man went to a surgeon, who looked him over and pronounced his condition serious, since his whole body was involved. This surgeon said he would probably be able to cure the man, though cure could not be guaranteed and the treatment would certainly take several years.

Not feeling happy with this possibility, the man with the splinter in his toe then went to another surgeon to get a second opinion. Luckily for him, this second doctor turned out to be Berne's down-to-earth grizzled veteran:
> And the other surgeon says, 'Oh, you've got an infected toe from this splinter.' And he takes a pair of tweezers and pulls out the splinter, and the fever goes down, the pulse goes down; then the head muscles relax and then the back muscles relax and then the feet muscles relax. And the guy's back to normal within forty-eight hours, maybe less. **So that's the way to practice psychotherapy. Like you find a splinter and you pull it out**. (Berne 1971: 12)

## pp. 70-71, The 'three ancient slogans'
They are: *primum non nocere; vis medicatrix naturae*; and *je le pensay, & Dieu le guarit*.
- *Primum non nocere* 'Above all, do no harm.' (Latin)
- *Vis medicatrix naturae* 'curative power of Nature' (Latin)
- *Je le pensay, & Dieu le guarit* 'I treat them, and God cures them.' (French)

---

Berne commented: 'The therapist does not cure anyone, he only treats him to the best of his ability, being careful not to injure and waiting for nature to take its healing course' (Berne 1966: 63). 

How can we reconcile this slogan, and the principle of *vis medicatrix naturae*, with Berne's insistence that 'the psychotherapist's job is to cure'? Berne himself supplied the answer. In practice, he wrote, 'curing the patient' means 'getting the patient ready for the cure to happen today'. But, Berne made clear, the *vis medicatrix naturae* did not provide the psychotherapist with an excuse for inactivity or slipshod work. Her task of 'getting the patient ready' demanded all her professional skills. In the exercise of those skills, she had to remain 'persistent, industrious, devoted, conscientious and acute'.
