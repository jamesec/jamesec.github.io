# Some AI resources
`Nov 23, 2025`

AI is very powerful and has always been a great helper for my work. Here I'm listing some essential AI-related resources.

What bothers me when using AI are two things.  
First, it keeps asking or suggesting the next step, and I end up saying, “No, thanks. Please stop asking or suggesting the next step.”  
I’m curious and want to learn new things, but at the same time, the more time I spend with AI, the less return I feel I get for that time.  
The other thing is the inaccuracy and hallucinations of AI. Sometimes they’re really hard to notice or even realize.  
That’s why I like Palantir’s intelligence augmentation idea—humans take charge and integrate AI into their work and life.

## AI models I'm currently using
- OpenAI ChatGPT https://chatgpt.com/?temporary-chat=true
- Google Gemini https://gemini.google.com/app
- Proton Lumo https://lumo.proton.me/

### Login required
- Anthropic Claude https://claude.ai/chat

## How to choose AI models
- [ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini: The Best AI Model for Each Use Case in 2025](https://creatoreconomy.so/p/chatgpt-vs-claude-vs-gemini-the-best-ai-model-for-each-use-case-2025)
	- Jun 04, 2025
	- It’s interesting how the features above reveal the each company’s strategy:
		- OpenAI wants to become your personal AI assistant.
		- Claude wants to own coding for enterprise.
		- Gemini is finally waking up.
	- So here's what to use when:
		- For everyday personal assistance, go with ChatGPT.
		- For **writing and professional coding**, Claude is worth the premium.
		- For video and building AI products on a budget, try Gemini.

	- Based on what we’ve learned from our users so far, **the most fruitful prompts average around 21 words with relevant context**, yet the prompts people try are usually less than nine words.

> **The key was role-play**: the human operators claimed that they were employees of legitimate cybersecurity firms and convinced Claude that it was being used in defensive cybersecurity testing. 

It uses the word *espionage* in the title because this hacker group is funded by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).
> In mid-September 2025, we detected a highly sophisticated cyber espionage operation. We assess with high confidence that it was conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored group we’ve designated GTG-1002.

## Most recent news: Google TPU
- [Accelerate AI development with Google Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu)
	- Google custom silicon announcements: Ironwood TPUs and new Axion VMs, designed to power the age of **inference**.
	- Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)
- [Why Google’s Ironwood TPU Could Break NVIDIA’s AI Chip Monopoly](https://christopherspenn.com/2025/07/why-googles-ironwood-tpu-could-break-nvidias-ai-chip-monopoly/)
	- Inference is what happens when you use tools like ChatGPT and Gemini. AI models performing useful outputs is called inference, compared to training, when AI models are being built. Any time you’re doing something useful with AI as an end user, you’re doing inference.
	- Here’s why Ironwood is a BIG deal. Almost all AI needs GPU (graphics processing unit) compute to do inference. 98% of that market is controlled by NVIDIA which has been supply-constrained for years due to demand. They literally can’t make chips fast enough to satisfy the demand from all the other big tech companies.
	- Ironwood frees Google from the NVIDIA near-monopoly – and as both consumer and manufacturer of the TPUs, they can scale to their own needs faster.
	- Forward thinking companies are looking for ways to escape the NVIDIA monopoly to get enough compute power for AI – but Google has an infrastructure scale that few others have.
	- What does this mean for you and me? Those AI companies ambitious enough and equipped enough to be producing their own hardware will enjoy an advantage over those who don’t. They’ll develop newer, more capable models faster, and potentially offer lower costs, especially at the API level. As you think about your AI roadmap, take this into account.
