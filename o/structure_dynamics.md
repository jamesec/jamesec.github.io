Dr. Berne published this book in 1963, after *Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy* but before the wildly successful *Games People Play*. I recommend it as 7/10, but if you're preparing for CTA exam, it probably is a must read for you. Insights from this book, such as ways to become a leader, what is psychological leadership, different membership types, etc., help me to understand groups in a deeper way, and I can apply those concepts accordingly to benefit myself from time to time.

Below are my reading notes.

## Group structure
p. 10, The most significant physical feature within the external group boundary was a curtain that separated Mr. Mead from the rest of the group, thus forming the major internal group boundary. The **external group boundary** (the walls of the house) and the major **internal group boundary** (the curtain), which separated the leader from the membership, together formed **the major group structure** (Fig. 4), shown schematically in Figure 5. The assignment of regions to the individual members was much less important for the outcome of the meeting than was the major group structure. These assignments determined **the minor group structure**, represented by the chairs. 

## Apparatus
p. 11, Such people, who deal with the internal arrangement of physical equipment, the establishment and the maintenance of internal group boundaries, group etiquette and other matters of internal regulation, may be called **the internal group apparatus**. In a complicated organization such as the United States the internal group apparatus is very large, and the four functions performed by Mrs. Mead are divided among a number of agencies, typified by the General Services Administration, the White House Staff and the Secret Service, the Department of the Interior and the law courts, respectively. In a business organization or scientific society these duties devolve on various executives and committees.

p. 71, In time of emergency the whole membership may be mobilized into the apparatus. If the external threat is very great, all other work may be suspended so that every able-bodied citizen can fight with the army. A similar mobilization takes place when an internal threat is grave, as in time of civil war. The **external apparatus** of a nation consists principally of **the army and the diplomatic corps**. The **internal apparatus** consists of **the police apparatus and the morale apparatus**.

## Become a leader
p. 11, Leadership is attained **by selection**, as in our country; **by accession**, as in Great Britain; **by pre-emption**, as in revolutions; or **by assump-tion**, as in lecture halls and schoolrooms, where a certain person is assumed by most of the members to be the best qualified individual present. In any case, it is customary to inform the membership of the leader's qualifications. In a republic this is usually done before the election; in an accession, at the time of investiture; in a revolution, during the consolidation; in an assumption, before the proceedings begin, fi at all. Such warrants may comprise a set of doctrines, a historical symbol, a show of force or a citation of titles. In most cases the warrants are presented by the morale branch of the internal apparatus, but, in Mr. Mead's case, he preferred to do it himself when he assumed the leadership.

p. 12, He went on in this strain for about 15 minutes. His self-description seemed well suited to appeal to certain needs of the members. It corresponded to the kind of leadership which many childlike people seem to want. Skillfully using a combination of drama and seductive-ness to appeal to the archaic aspects of the personality, Mr. Mead characterized himself as a prodigy, from childhood on the instrument of supernatural forces that endowed him with magic powers, thus rendering him (he hinted) indefatigable, incorruptible, omnipotent, omniscient, immortal, fearless and invulnerable. He held out to the members the hope that they too could attain some measure of these qualities through him, if they put themselves at the disposal of the primal forces which he represented and adhered to a special canon of feeling and behavior. After he had finished outlining this self-presentation or persona, Mrs. Mead drew the curtain. This was the signal that the function of **establishing the leadership** was completed and that the group activity was about to begin.

## Responsible, effective and psychological leader
p. 105, There are three kinds of leadership, corresponding to the three aspects of the group structure. **The responsible leader** is the front man, the man who fills the role of leader in the organizational structure. **The effective leader**, who makes the actual decisions, may or may not have a role in the organizational structure. He may be the man in the back room, but he is the most important person in the individual structure. **The psychological leader** is the one who is most powerful in the private structures of the members and occupies the leadership slot in their group imagoes. All three types of leadership may be invested in the same individual, but there are all sorts of combinations. Thus, in the British Government, the Prime Minister is the responsible and effective leader, and the monarch is the psychological leader. In certain of our cities, the mayor is the responsible and psychological leader, and the ward boss is the effective leader. In certain criminal groups the front men are the responsible leaders, while another man who has no fixed role in the organizational structure is the effective and psychological leader.

But since the private structure usually comes out into the open in times of stress or over the long term, the psychological leadership may become clearer in historical situations. For example, in the case of the British Empire, it is quite certain that Queen Victoria, even when she was not constitutionally responsible or effective, was psychologically supreme. **No matter how distinguished her prime ministers were, this period is still known as the Victorian era**, and the Queen was very likely the most influential person of her time.

The effective leader can be distinguished by studying the group in action. He is the one whose questions are most likely to be answered or whose suggestions are most likely to be followed in situations of stress.

The responsible leader is the individual who is going to be called to account by higher authority if things go wrong-the experimenter in an experimental group and the executive in a business group. Since in many organizations the responsible leader is only a front, it is here that dominance, popularity and helpfulness find their usefulness. A man who possesses these qualities may be attractive to the members and thus serve the purposes of the effective leadership.

The psychological leader of a group occupies a special position, whether or not he is also the responsible and effective leader. Themembers demand certain qualities of the psychological leader, the one who is likely to survive in the group tradition as a euhemerus. And these are the qualities of a god. The leader is supposed to be omnipotent, omniscient, immortal, invulnerable, irresistible, incorruptible, unseducible, indefatigable and fearless. These are the same qualities that were attributed in ancient times to emperors such as "theunequalled, almightly, invincible, unwavering Assur-nasir-pal." If a leader in real life fails in any one of these respects, there will always be those who will criticise him for it. For example this happens if an American president shows weakness, ignorance, sickness, touchiness, corruptibility or fear. The effects soon begin to show in the stock market, the political cartoons and the letters to the editor. Even a group therapist is supposed to have most of these qualities. In many groups, the members will become uneasy if he so much as has a cold. He will be teased, some patients will say that they feel insecure because he got sick, and some of them will ask how he can cure them if he gets sick himself.

The one who first establishes the group is the primal leader. Leaders who follow in his footsteps may be called executives. Subsequent leaders who change the constitution are to that extent again primal leaders.

In our own country the three most euhemerized presidents, Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt, were all war presidents and were all able to take the responsibility for killing. 

So the basic tests of leadership are **the responsibility** and **the right (organizationally) to apply sanctions and give rewards**, and **the ability (individually) to do so irrevocably**.

## Membership
p. 117, Closely related to the permeability of the external boundary are the circumstances under which it may be crossed. This leads to a distinction by classes of membership: **voluntary**, by application; **optional**, by invitation; **conditional**, by achievement; and **obligatory**, by draft. To these may be added memberships which are **accidental**, as by accident of birth.

p. 118, If the internal group process is actively under way, it may be either mild or intense. For example, **the Swiss seem to have found satisfactory solutions for certain internal problems**, so that when things are quiet on the national scene they go about their business in a relaxed way, and if disputations do break out, they are usually mild. A South American country, on the other hand, may be tense in anticipation of an assassination or a revolution, and if it occurs, it may be followed by intense fighting. 

## The birth of a nation
pp. 92-104

p. 103, It is evident that the word "**patriotism**" is subject to vulgarization and **exploitation by special interests in various countries**.
