Morty delivers a rousing speech to **himselves**. (from: S01.E10 âˆ™ Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind)

Help!<br>
There is no escape, my son, we will find our peace in the next world.

So what... you're just gonna give up?<br>
We're giving in to the power of the one true Morty, one day he will return.

All right Mortys, listen up, my name is Morty Smith, from earth dimension C-137, I know you're scared because I'm scared, but that's no reason to accept our fate. We're Mortys, **we're not defined by** our relationships to Rick, **our destiny is our own!**

This sounds like something the one true Morty might say.<br>
I'm sick of being a human shield, uh I want to be a gardener.

I want to write really crazy intense action novels.<br>
I'm more than just a hammer.<br>
He's the one true Morty!

Keep it down!<br>
Ohhhhh!
