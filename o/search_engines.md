# Which search engine works Best?
`Feb 16, 2026`

In the age of artificial intelligence, I still use search engines. It’s easier and more direct to find the information I want—not to mention avoiding annoying AI hallucinations.

Which search engine works best for me? I got some ideas from [Helium browser](https://helium.computer/) and added Startpage to the original list based on what Helium listed.

- Recommended: [Startpage](https://startpage.com/), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), Kagi (if willing to pay)
- Semi-recommended: Ecosia, Qwant
- Not-recommended: Google, Microsoft Bing

## Recommended
Startpage  
Privacy-focused. Uses Google results but removes all trackers and personal data.  
Promises to never store your IP or search history. Simple, familiar interface without profiling.

You can customize Startpage on the settings page.

Copy the Settings URL below, then bookmark or set as homepage.

DuckDuckGo  
Privacy-focused. Relies on Bing results but promises to never track or profile you.

Kagi  
Privacy-focused. Customizable results without ads or tracking.
Requires a paid account.

## Semi-recommended
Ecosia  
May plant trees for clicking ads. Relies on Bing and Google. Sends tracking data to Microsoft and Google.

Qwant  
Based in Europe. Uses Bing results. Sends tracking data to Microsoft.

## Not-recommended
Google  
It's Google. It dominates the search market, collects extensive personal data, and profiles you.

Microsoft Bing  
Collects extensive personal data. Privacy controls are buried and limited. Subjectively overwhelming UI.
