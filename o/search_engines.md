## Recommended
DuckDuckGo  
Privacy-focused. Relies on Bing results but promises to never track or profile you.

Kagi  
Privacy-focused. Customizable results without ads or tracking.
Requires a paid account.

## Semi-recommended
Ecosia  
May plant trees for clicking ads. Relies on Bing and Google. Sends tracking data to Microsoft and Google.

Qwant  
Based in Europe. Uses Bing results. Sends tracking data to Microsoft.

## Not-recommended
Google  
It's Google. It dominates the search market, collects extensive personal data, and profiles you.

Microsoft Bing  
Collects extensive personal data. Privacy controls are buried and limited. Subjectively overwhelming UI.
