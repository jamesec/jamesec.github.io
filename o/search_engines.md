# Which search engine works best?
`Feb 16, 2026`

In the age of artificial intelligence, I still use search engines. It’s easier and more direct to find the information I want—not to mention avoiding annoying AI hallucinations.

Which search engine works best for me? I got some ideas from [the Helium browser](https://helium.computer/) and added Startpage to the original selection from Helium.

- Recommended: [Startpage](https://startpage.com/), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), Kagi (if willing to pay)
- Semi-recommended: Ecosia, Qwant
- Not-recommended: Google, Microsoft Bing

Privacy-focused. Uses Google results but removes all trackers and personal data.  
Promises to never store your IP or search history. Simple, familiar interface without profiling.

You can customize Startpage on the settings page.

May plant trees for clicking ads. Relies on Bing and Google. Sends tracking data to Microsoft and Google.

## Not-recommended
<img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googleg/1x/googleg_standard_color_128dp.png" width="32" height="32"> Google  
It's Google. It dominates the search market, collects extensive personal data, and profiles you.

<img src="https://www.bing.com/sa/simg/favicon-trans-bg-blue-mg-png.png" width="32" height="32"> Microsoft Bing  
Collects extensive personal data. Privacy controls are buried and limited. Subjectively overwhelming UI.
