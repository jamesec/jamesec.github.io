# UnGoogled Chromium browser with extensions
`Updated: May 8, 2025 / April 23, 2024`

This article outlines the steps on a Mac.

**Step 1:** Download and install `UnGoogled Chromium`.  
https://techspot.com/downloads/7181-ungoogled-chromium.html  
A lightweight approach to removing Google web service dependency.

I've used it for a long time with no issues. However, since it's a precompiled binary, use it at your own risk.  
Alternatively, you can compile it from [the source code](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium).

As you manually install the downloaded `UnGoogled Chromium` App, click this button to allow it to run:  
(macOS) System Settings → Privacy & Security → Security → Open Anyway

## Change this Chromium flag
**Step 2:** Change this Chromium flag and relaunch the app.

Run the `UnGoogled Chromium` app you downloaded, and it will display the page: `chrome://ungoogled-first-run/`, which includes the instructions:
- Set `chrome://flags/#extension-mime-request-handling` to `Always prompt for install` and relaunch.
- Then click on the latest `Chromium.Web.Store.crx` link on [the extension's Releases page](https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store/releases/latest) (as shown in Step 3 below).

## Extension - Chromium Web Store
**Step 3:** Install the `Chromium Web Store` extension.

[Chromium Web Store extension](https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store/releases/latest)  
Click on `Chromium.Web.Store.crx`. A prompt will appear: Add "Chromium Web Store"?  
Click "Add extension", done.  
It has been successfully installed, and you can skip the manual installation steps outlined below.  
Pin the `Chromium Web Store` badge in your browser's toolbar. (Badges are hidden by default)

For certain older versions of `UnGoogled Chromium`, you may need to install this extension manually.

### Manually install an extension
- **Use Safari Browser** to download the .crx file.
	- [Chromium Web Store extension](https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store/releases/latest)
- Change the extension name from .crx to **.cab**
- Use the Keka App to unpack it into a folder.
	- https://keka.io/en/ Download the Keka App **directly from the website** (there's a small link, something like:  Download v1.4.8), instead of downloading it from the Mac App Store - unless you want to pay $4.99 as a kind of donation.
- For these manually installed extensions, give them specific folders:
	- Such as, ~/Downloads/Chromium Extensions/Chromium.Web.Store 1.5.4.3/
- Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chromium, then turn on "Developer mode".
- Click "Load unpacked", then choose the folder from the previous step.

## Extensions
<span style="border-bottom:1.5px solid; border-bottom-color:#f55066;">If you rarely use an extension, disable it at `chrome://extensions/` and re-enable it when needed.</span> For example, I only enable the `Awesome Screen Recorder & Screenshot` extension when I want to capture a full-page screenshot of a webpage.

- [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
  - uBlock Origin - An efficient blocker for Chromium and Firefox. Fast and lean.
