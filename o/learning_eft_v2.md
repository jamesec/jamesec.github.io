## Book review
**Curious About Emotions? Start Here!**

I like this book! It’s incredibly rich for learning emotion-focused therapy—almost like a trusty bible for developing your conceptual and perceptual skills as you bring the EFT approach into your practice.

For example, Chapter 6 introduces the latest EFT markers, and Chapter 18 (“Recommendations for Teaching and Learning Emotion-Focused Therapy”) presents a clear and thoughtful EFT supervision framework.

I’m fortunate to have met three of the four authors—Robert, Rhonda, and Leslie—and they’re all wonderful mentors. I truly appreciate the chance to learn from them.

I highly recommend this book to any therapist with a curious mind who wants to bring the latest evidence-based research on human emotions into their practice.
