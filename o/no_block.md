Hey Sue. Thank you for having me and thank you for doing this important work.

So many people have something to say and yet when it's time to say it, when it's time to write our book, we hesitate, we get frozen, we get stressed, we procrastinate.

There's one big reason for this and a couple small things that can help. The big reason is **because you care**. You care about the work. You care about being judged. You care about the permanence of it. You care about all the overhead that comes from doing this sort of work. 

And caring, it's a good thing. It's a sign that **you're doing something that matters**.

And then there are some confusions. The biggest confusion, the easiest one to fix is that publishing and printing are the same thing, and they're not. Printing, particularly digital printing is super easy and cheap, and you can do it in 15 minutes. You can put your book out on the Kindle. You can put it out as a PDF. You can put it out as a blog. Here it is. I made this. There's no stress, particularly if you decide to write it under another name. There's nothing holding us back if we realize that printing is easy. Publishing? Publishing is hard. Publishing is taking a financial risk to bring a new idea to people who don't know it exists yet. So they will pay you money for it. Maybe you don't need to be published and maybe you don't wanna publish your own book. That's fine. Put it out there. Put it out there, and if it spreads and people ask for more, then you know you're onto something. And if it doesn't, your next one's going to be better. But we need to not get hung up on this idea of bestseller lists and Amazon reviews and publishing. 

So I wrote this book called *The Practice*, and it asserts that there's no such thing as writer's block because no one gets plumber's block. No one gets juggler's block. Why do we get writer's block? What we actually have is a fear of being judged, a fear that our stuff won't be good enough. And so we say, I don't have any ideas. I don't know what to say. Well, no, **you have plenty of ideas**, but you're worried they're bad ones. And so the opportunity, I learned this from my colleague and friend Isaac Asimov. I was in my twenties and he was in his seventies at the time. He said, look, this solution is simple. You just need more bad writing. **That, if you do enough bad writing, it is inevitable that some good writing will slip through.**

A couple other things that I want to highlight and then I'm gonna let you go. One of them is this idea of imposter syndrome. Who are you to write a book? When we feel like an imposter, it's easy to start judging all of our credentials, all of our experience, and the fact that we have never written this book before. Who are you to do this writing? Well, making imposter syndrome go away is a difficult fool's errand because the harder you try to reassure yourself and to rationalize the worse it gets. Now the answer is to realize that you are an imposter and so am I. That when we feel like an imposter, it's a good thing, cuz it shows that we're onto something, that we're doing something that might not work, that we're doing something that's worth sharing. So when you feel like an imposter, you could act a little bit like they act in the Boston Marathon at mile 20. **When you get tired, you can't make the tired go away, but you can dance with it.** You can acknowledge that it is impossible to run a good marathon without getting tired, and it is impossible to do this work, this important work, this significant work without feeling like an imposter. So the last thing I'll leave you with is from my most recent book, *The Song of Significance*. And in it, what I say is simple. We don't have to be cogs in the machine. We don't have to wait for instructions. We don't have to just do what the boss told us to do. The industrial age is coming to an end. What we can do is **show up and lead** and say, **here I made this**. Then <span style="border-bottom:1.5px solid; border-bottom-color:#f55066;">when we turn on lights for other people, when we do work that matters, we get a chance to do it again</span>. And what could be better than that? Thank you for making a ruckus.

Thank you for being part of this. Can't wait to see what you make next.
